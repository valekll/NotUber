# NotUber
A ride sharing android application. This application uses Google's Firebase service for the database and user authentification. This application uses multiple fragments and layouts to login, sign up, request rides, track ride points, see available rides, and give rides. The scope of this project is limited, and therefore GPS tracking data was not added to prevent slippage.
